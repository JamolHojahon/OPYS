# `/pkg`

Library code that's safe to use by external applications (e.g., `/pkg/mypubliclib`).

Other projects will import these libraries expecting them to work, so think twice before you put something here :-)

Examples:

* https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg
* https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/pkg
* https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/master/pkg
* https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master/pkg
* https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/pkg
